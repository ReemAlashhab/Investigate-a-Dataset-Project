# Investigate-a-Dataset-Project

In this project,I analyzed the data set of The Movie Database ( TMDb). This data set contains
information about 10,000 movies between 1960 and 2015 . I went the through the four phases of
data analysis : data wrangling , data exploratory analysis , drawing conclusions from data , and
communicating results to answer questions related to this data set in the Jupyter notebook
environment.
